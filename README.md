# fsview - Lazarus package

## Short description

This is contains the component prototype TFileSystemView. Installing is not tested, yet. 

## Test environment

I suggest to append the package to your application and then create and insert the component in your code (at runtime). You can use a form as owner and a TWinControl component as Parent. This way of testing avoids to compile Lazarus for every new test without to know, that it will work. In case of faults only your application will crash.

I will announce here, when it will be ready to install in the component panel of Lazarus.
